5
Let us not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless when facing them.
Everything comes to us that belongs to us if we create the capacity to receive it.
Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark.
You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.
Love does not claim possession, but gives freedom.
