Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It is the greatest heresy to think so. If there is sin, this is the only sin; to say that you are weak, or others are weak.
Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.
All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark.
You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.
Arise! Awake! and stop not until the goal is reached.
