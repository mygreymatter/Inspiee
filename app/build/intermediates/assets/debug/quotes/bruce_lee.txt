Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.
If you love life, don't waste time, time is what life is made up of.
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.
If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.
As you think, so shall you become.
